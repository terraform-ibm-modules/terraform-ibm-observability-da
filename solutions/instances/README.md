- A resource group, if one is not passed in.
- A log analysis instance,
- A cloud monitoring instance,
- Provisions a cloud object storage(COS) instance and KMS encrypted bucket which is required to store log archives.

**NB:** This solution is not intended to be called by one or more other modules since it contains a provider configurations, meaning it is not compatible with the `for_each`, `count`, and `depends_on` arguments.
