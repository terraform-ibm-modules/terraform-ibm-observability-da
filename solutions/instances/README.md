# IBM Observability Instances Deployable Architecture

This architecture creates the observability instances on IBM Cloud and supports provisioning the following resources:

- A resource group, if one is not passed in.
- A Log Analysis instance.
- A Cloud Monitoring instance.
- Creates a Cloud Object Storage (COS) instance or supports using an existing one.
- Supports creating KMS root keys in an existing KMS instance or using existing keys if creating new buckets.
- Creates a KMS encrypted COS bucket that is required to store archived logs or using an existing bucket.
- Creates a KMS encrypted COS bucket for setting up Activity Tracker event routing or using an existing bucket.
- Supports configuring the Activity Tracker event routing to the Cloud Object Storage (COS) bucket and to the Log Analysis instance .

**NB:** This solution is not intended to be called by one or more other modules since it contains a provider configurations, meaning it is not compatible with the `for_each`, `count`, and `depends_on` arguments.
