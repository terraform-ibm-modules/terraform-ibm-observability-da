# Configuring complex inputs for Cloud Automation for Observability

Several optional input variables in the IBM Cloud [Observability instances deployable architecture](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog#deployable_architecture) use complex object types. You specify these inputs when you configure deployable architecture.

* Cloud Logs Event Notification Instances (`cloud_logs_existing_en_instances`)
* Cloud Logs policies (`cloud_logs_policies`)
* Metrics Router Routes (`metrics_router_routes`)


## Cloud Logs Event Notification Instances <a name="cloud_logs_existing_en_instances"></a>

The `cloud_logs_existing_en_instances` input variable allows you to provide a list of existing Event Notification (EN) instances that will be integrated with the Cloud Logging service. For each EN instance, you need to specify its CRN (Cloud Resource Name). You can also optionally configure a integration name and control whether to skip the creation of an authentication policy for the instance.

- Variable name: `cloud_logs_existing_en_instances`.
- Type: A list of objects. Each object represents an EN instance.
- Default value: An empty list (`[]`).

### Options for cloud_logs_existing_en_instances

  - `instance_crn` (required): The Cloud Resource Name (CRN) of the Event Notification instance.
  - `integration_name` (optional): The name of the Event Notification integration that gets created. If a prefix input variable is passed, it is prefixed to the value in the `<prefix>-value` format. Defaults to `"cloud-logs-en-integration"`.
  - `skip_en_auth_policy` (optional): A boolean flag to determine whether to skip the creation of an authentication policy that allows Cloud Logs 'Event Source Manager' role access in the existing event notification instance. Defaults to `false`.

### Example Event Notification Instance Configuration

```hcl
cloud_logs_existing_en_instances = [
  {
    instance_crn        = "crn:v1:bluemix:public:...:event-notifications:instance"
    integration_name    = "custom-logging-en-integration"
    skip_en_auth_policy = true
  },
  {
    instance_crn        = "crn:v1:bluemix:public:...:event-notifications:instance"
    skip_en_auth_policy = false
  }
]
```

In this example:
- The first EN instance has a integration name `"custom-logging-en-integration"` and skips the authentication policy.
- The second EN instance uses the default integration name and includes the authentication policy.

## Cloud Logs Policies <a name="cloud_logs_policies"></a>

The `cloud_logs_policies` input variable allows you to provide a list of policies that will be configured in the Cloud Logs service. Refer [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-logs?topic=cloud-logs-tco-optimizer) for more information.

- Variable name: `cloud_logs_policies`.
- Type: A list of objects. Each object represents a policy.
- Default value: An empty list (`[]`).

### Options for cloud_logs_policies

  - `logs_policy_name` (required): The unique policy name.
  - `logs_policy_description` (optional): The description of the policy to create.
  - `logs_policy_priority` (required): The priority to determine the pipeline for the logs. Allowed values are: type_unspecified, type_block, type_low, type_medium, type_high. High (priority value) sent to 'Priority insights' (TCO pipleine), Medium to 'Analyze and alert', Low to 'Store and search', Blocked are not sent to any pipeline.
  - `application_rule` (optional): The rules to include in the policy configuration for matching applications.
  - `subsystem_rule` (optional): The subsystem rules to include in the policy configuration for matching applications.
  - `log_rules` (required): The log severities to include in the policy configuration.
  - `archive_retention` (optional): Define archive retention.

### Example cloud_logs_policies

```hcl
cloud_logs_policies = [
  {
    logs_policy_name     = "logs-policy-1"
    logs_policy_description = "Send info and debug logs of the application (name starts with `test-system-app`) and the subsytem (name starts with `test-sub-system`) logs to Store nad search pipeline"
    logs_policy_priority = "type_low"
    application_rule = [{
      name         = "test-system-app"
      rule_type_id = "start_with"
    }]
    log_rules = [{
      severities = ["info", "debug"]
    }]
    subsystem_rule = [{
      name         = "test-sub-system"
      rule_type_id = "start_with"
    }]
  },
  {
    logs_policy_name     = "logs-policy-2"
    logs_policy_description = "Send error logs of all applications and all subsystems to Analyze and Alert pipeline"
    logs_policy_priority = "type_medium"
    log_rules = [{
      severities = ["error"]
    }]
  }
]
```

## Metrics Router Routes <a name="metrics_router_routes"></a>

The `metrics_router_routes` input variable allows you to provide a list of routes that will be configured in the IBM Cloud Metrics Routing. Refer [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/metrics-router?topic=metrics-router-about) for more information.

- Variable name: `metrics_router_routes`.
- Type: A list of objects. Each object represents a route.
- Default value: An empty list (`[]`).

### Options for metrics_router_routes

  - `name` (required):  The name of the route.
  - `rules` (required): The routing rules that will be evaluated in their order of the array. You can configure up to 10 rules per route.
    - `action` (optional): The action if the inclusion_filters matches, default is send action. Allowed values are `send` and `drop`.
    - `inclusion_filters` (required): A list of conditions to be satisfied for routing metrics to pre-defined target.'inclusion_filters' is an object with three parameters:
        - `operand` - Part of CRN that can be compared with values. Allowable values are: `location`, `service_name`, `service_instance`, `resource_type`, `resource`.

        - `operator` - The operation to be performed between operand and the provided values. Allowable values are: `is`, `in`.

        - `values` - The provided string values of the operand to be compared with.
    - `targets` (required): The target uuid for a pre-defined metrics router target.

### Example metrics_router_routes

```hcl
metrics_router_routes = {
    name = "my-route"
    rules {
      action = "send"
      targets {
        id = "c3af557f-fb0e-4476-85c3-0889e7fe7bc4"
      }
      inclusion_filters {
        operand = "location"
        operator = "is"
        values = [ "us-south" ]
      }
    }
}
```
