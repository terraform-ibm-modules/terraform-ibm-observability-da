# Add observability agents to a RedHat OpenShift Cluster

This architecture deploys observability agents (log analysis and cloud monitoring agent) on a RedHat OpenShift Cluster.

## Before you begin

* You must have RedHat OpenShift Cluster deployed.

* You must have deployed observability instances (log analysis and cloud monitoring) for which specific agents are required.
